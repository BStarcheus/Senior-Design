# Tasks

All tasks are assigned to Brandon Starcheus

- Design and develop an OpenAI Gym environment to represent the board and rules of Coup

- Design and develop a desktop application that interfaces with the Coup environment to allow for gameplay between the computer and human opponents

- Research various RL techniques to determine the most applicable strategy for this problem (MC vs TD, etc)

- Investigate the need for specific RL agent initialization (instead of starting with a clean slate)

- Develop an RL agent that is capable of improving over many iterations of playing Coup

- Test the agent for improvement over many games with human opponent(s)

- Research RL methods for self-play

- Develop a framework for self-play, where many agents play against each other and all learn from their experiences

- Validate the agent's improvement and convergence via self-play

- Test the converged agent against a human opponent to evaluate learned skill

- Document how the agent learned to use deception over many iterations and investigate the strategies it uses
