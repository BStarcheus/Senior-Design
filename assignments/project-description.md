### Project Area: Reinforcement Learning

### Abstract
Reinforcement learning has been applied to many games like Chess and Go, and even games involving deceit like Poker. The board game Coup is another deception-based game where players have certain “legal” actions they can take based on their cards, but they can also take any “illegal” action. Other players can “call out” someone they think is taking an illegal action. In this project, we hope to analyze the learning of an RL agent as it builds skill in the game. We want to understand how the agent learns to lie and the strategies for deceit is uses. We will analyze the results of training an agent with human opponents, as well as with self-play by playing against other agents (itself).
