# Project Constraints

### Time
Since this is a solo project, I won't be as constrained with time as other teams since I can start this project early, work at my own pace, and continue work over winter break. However, it is an ambitious idea and time will always play a role. Time is required for research, development, testing, training, and refinement. I do not yet know how many different RL methods and strategies I will need to try. I do not yet know how long training will take, either against human opponents or with self-play. There may be other difficulties that arise in the development process. All of these unknowns could contribute to a greater time requirement than previously estimated. 

### Scope
In order to best constrain the time of the project, it is necessary to limit the scope. After discussion with my advisor, we are already working on revising my initial idea of the scope. There is the possibility that we add a few tasks and remove a few others that would be good extensions to the project which would make a good addition to my MS thesis. Even after this initial planning, due to my lack of technical experience in RL there may be aspects of development that encompass a lot more than previously thought. With that in mind, as long as I am staying in contact with my advisor and we both continue to discuss the scope of what I am currently working on and what I will work on in the future, then the scope should stay properly constrained.

### Technical Expertise
While I have been researching and learning about the concepts and math of reinfocement learning periodically in the last two years, I do not have any solid experience in implementation. This lack of experience will create a strong learning curve in the beginning, which is why I have scheduled time for research and experimentation. If either of these requires more time to fully develop my knowledge, then that is what will be best for the final project. On the other hand, since I already have a good foundation of the concepts, I have strong programming skills, and I have worked on large solo projects before (i.e. compiler from scratch) I believe this project is well within my abilities.

### Ethical / Legal
The main question being asked by my project is "how would AI agents learn to lie, and what strategies would they use with deception?". This raises several ethical questions. How could someone abuse the findings to create a AI focused on deception in other domains. Could this be applied to phishing, scamming, etc? On the other hand, it may not be so far reaching since the choice to lie is just another potential action in the game, but with a different level of risk. 

There is also a legal constraint, due to the use of the board game "Coup", which is copyrighted. Since I will create a way for humans to play against the RL agent in order to train it, this could be seen as creating a platform to play the game against an AI bot. This is exactly what it is, but unlike other game platforms meant for entertainment this is meant to train an RL agent for research purposes. In the end it may be a good opponent, but in the beginning it will be like playing against someone who doesn't understand the game at all. Regardless, the best option is most likely to keep the repository private to limit the exposure of the IP, though this will be investigated further.
