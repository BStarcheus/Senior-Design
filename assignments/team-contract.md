# Senior Design Project Team Contract

## Team Name: BTS

## Team Members
- Brandon Starcheus (CS) - starchbt@mail.uc.edu

## Team Meetings
Since this is a solo team, I will focus on meetings with the advisor. I hope to have meetings at least once a month, though preferably biweekly or even weekly. We will discuss current progress, issues or decisions to be made, and potential for improvement. 

## Project Focus and Responsibilites
The project will focus on solving a problem using reinforcement learning. Since I am the only member of the team, I will be responsible for the research, implementation, testing, documentation, and class assignments. This project will also transition into my focus for my MS Thesis.
