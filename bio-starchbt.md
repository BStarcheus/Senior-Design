## Project Sought
Since I am an ACCEND student, I'd ideally like to find a project that naturally leads into an MS thesis. I am most interested in the above areas, though most of my work experience is in tool building and automation. I am most skilled in the back-end type of work like algorithms, though I can do front-end when necessary. Outside of computing, I am interested in topics like the environment, health & fitness, and music.
